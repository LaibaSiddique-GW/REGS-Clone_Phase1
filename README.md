Please feel free to organize this repository as you see fit.

Please populate the `report_phase1.md` file by your demo. The Phase 2 team will use this documentation to understand your project.

# Code Review Process

This is the process for code review.

After code is pushed and ready for review:
- Each other member must check for bugs including testing it.
- Testing must include determining if the new code works with previous code/determining if new bugs have arised.
- Any changes (after being pushed) must be re-reviewed by the original team member as well with a comment explaining with bug fix/changes on both the trello card and in the code. 
- If no changes are done, the second team member to review the code can mark that trello card as done and merge the changes to the main branch.
- After all review is over, the second team member will message the others about the request being merged/completed.
- Code review must be completed by the next Lab or within 72 hours, given it is posted the prior night (or earlier).
 
Team Rules:

- Must respond within 24 hours. 
- Each student must review/do code reviews before the next lab session/meeting. 
- All work will be agreed upon and distributed immediately. 
- All pull requests must be approved by 2 other team members before merging. 
- Merge request issues must be resolved by all parties whose code is involved in the error. 
- Decide on rough plan of the coming week each Wednesday/Lab. 
- Keep Trello boad up date and move your tasks (whatever you did) along accordingly. 
- Commit on your branch often so you dont lose your changes, can look back to previous code, and to avoid code corruption. 
- Communicate if you will be absent, late, or must leave early. 

Project Planning:

- Task organization will be done via our [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/67e447534e9f0d4964eb20a3/ATTI94a1514ebbc21f82a16eeea315e9691c510CD4D0/team-13-data-detectives).
- The Trello board will be kept up to date and relevent throughout the whole process.
- The primary method of communication will be our Discord group chat.
- Planning will take place during class, lab, and virtually.
